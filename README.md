Password Generator

Welcome to the Password Generator! This is a simple Python program that allows you to generate random simple and strong passwords. The program gives you the flexibility to choose the number of alphabets, numbers, and special characters you want in your password.

Features:

Simple Password: A password that contains only the specified characters (letters, digits, and symbols).

Strong Password: A more randomized password that combines letters, digits, and symbols, and shuffles the characters to ensure maximum randomness.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Run the script in your terminal or command prompt.
The program will ask for the following inputs:
The number of alphabets you want in your password.
The number of numbers you want in your password.
The number of special characters you want in your password.
The program will generate both a simple and a strong password based on your inputs.
You can choose the password you prefer based on your needs.
